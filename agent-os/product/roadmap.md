# Product Roadmap

1. [ ] Homepage as Filter — Create the landing page that clearly articulates the problem-first lens, setting expectations that this is a thinking space rather than a portfolio or pitch. Include a concise statement of purpose and navigation to core content areas. `S`

2. [ ] Content Architecture — Define and implement the content structure for Problem Notes and Case Studies, including frontmatter schema, URL patterns, and file organization for Markdown/MDX content. `S`

3. [ ] Problem Notes Stream — Build the thinking stream section displaying short, structured pieces on problems. Include list view with titles and brief descriptions, individual note pages, and clear visual treatment for "unfinished" or "evolving" status. `M`

4. [ ] Case Studies Section — Create the deep-dive case study section with pages that support longer-form content, constraint/trade-off documentation, and outcome reflection. Design for few entries with high signal density. `M`

5. [ ] Now Page — Implement a living "now" page for current explorations and focus areas. Should be easy to update frequently and signal that the site is actively maintained without formal publishing pressure. `XS`

6. [ ] Typography and Visual Design — Establish minimal, typography-focused styling across all pages. Optimize for reading experience, signal density, and calm visual tone. No heavy frameworks—custom CSS with clear hierarchy. `S`

7. [ ] Navigation and Information Architecture — Implement site-wide navigation that supports the core content areas (Home, Problem Notes, Case Studies, Now) with clear wayfinding and minimal friction. `XS`

8. [ ] Invitation to Engage — Add clear but understated contact/engagement pathways. Design to encourage thoughtful outreach while the content quality itself filters for serious engagement. `XS`

> - Each item is end-to-end functional and testable—visitors can use completed features immediately
> - Explicit non-goals for this roadmap: CMS integration, analytics, complex interactivity, SEO optimization, monetization features
