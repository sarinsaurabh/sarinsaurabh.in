# Product Mission

## Pitch

sarinsaurabh.in is a personal, public workspace that helps thoughtful visitors—hiring managers, collaborators, and curious peers—quickly assess how I think by providing high-signal problem-first content that showcases depth, judgment, and evolving ideas without the polish pressure of traditional portfolios. This site is intentionally small, opinionated, and incomplete.

## Users

### Primary Visitors

- **Hiring managers and founders**: Evaluating senior product/strategy talent, seeking signal over salesmanship
- **Operators and builders**: Working on complex, ambiguous problems and looking for serious thinking partners
- **Potential collaborators**: Exploring ideas and evaluating fit for meaningful projects
- **Curious peers**: Enjoying problem framing and first-principles thinking

### User Personas

**The Evaluator** (35-50)
- **Role:** Hiring manager, founder, or team lead
- **Context:** Building a team for complex product/strategy work; tired of polished resumes that hide actual thinking ability
- **Pain Points:** Hard to assess thinking quality from standard portfolios; wants evidence of judgment, not just outcomes
- **Goals:** Quickly determine if a conversation is worth having; find people who think clearly under ambiguity

**The Collaborator** (28-45)
- **Role:** Operator, researcher, or builder
- **Context:** Working on hard problems; seeking people who engage seriously rather than performatively
- **Pain Points:** Too many shallow takes online; hard to find calm, honest thinking
- **Goals:** Identify potential thinking partners; explore ideas with someone who values depth

**The Curious Peer** (25-40)
- **Role:** Practitioner or thinker in adjacent domains
- **Context:** Enjoys intellectual exploration; values problem framing over solution evangelism
- **Pain Points:** Noise and overconfidence dominate online discourse; craves substance
- **Goals:** Learn new frames; encounter honest uncertainty; find refreshing perspectives

## The Problem

### Personal Websites Optimize for Presentation, Not Thinking

Most personal websites reduce people to titles and timelines, or over-index on polished outputs. They function as resumes or portfolios—optimized for impression management rather than intellectual signal. This creates several problems:

- **For visitors:** No way to assess how someone actually thinks; forced to rely on credentials and curated highlights
- **For creators:** Pressure to appear finished and authoritative; no space for evolving, unfinished work
- **For everyone:** Shallow self-promotion crowds out meaningful engagement

**The Approach:** A workspace that inverts the typical approach—leading with problems rather than solutions, welcoming unfinished thinking, and optimizing for signal density over polish. The site functions as a lens into how I approach complex, ambiguous problems, not a sales pitch for who I am.

## Differentiators

### Problem-First, Not Solution-First

Unlike typical portfolios that showcase polished outcomes, this site leads with problems: why they matter, why common approaches fail, and how to reframe them. Visitors encounter thinking-in-progress rather than retrospective success stories.

This results in higher signal about judgment and approach, attracting people who value depth over presentation.

### Comfortable with Uncertainty

Unlike content optimized for authority and SEO, this site explicitly welcomes unfinished thinking and evolving ideas. There is no pressure to have answers—only to think clearly about questions.

This results in a durable system for thinking in public that attracts meaningful, non-transactional conversations rather than shallow engagement.

### Signal Density Over Volume

Unlike blogs that optimize for publishing cadence or engagement metrics, every piece of content exists to demonstrate thinking quality. There is no filler, no SEO plays, no content calendar pressure.

This results in a site where visitors can trust that anything they read is worth their time.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Homepage as filter:** Clear articulation of the problem-first lens, signaling immediately that this is a thinking space, not a pitch
- **Problem Notes (Thinking Stream):** Short, structured pieces exploring problems—why they matter, why common solutions fail, reframing attempts; explicitly welcomes unfinished thinking
- **Case Studies (Few, Deep):** Real problems with real constraints, trade-offs, decision-making processes, and outcomes including imperfect ones; demonstrates applied judgment

### Living Content

- **Now Page:** Current explorations and focus areas; keeps the site alive and evolving without publish pressure

### Engagement

- **Clear Invitation:** Encourages thoughtful outreach through content quality itself; discourages shallow contact by setting expectations through depth

## What This Site Is Not

- Not a resume or CV
- Not a blog optimized for SEO or publishing cadence

- Not a "personal brand" exercise

## Success Criteria

**For visitors:**

- See evidence of depth, judgment, and intellectual honesty
- Can decide within minutes if a conversation is worth having

**For me:**
- Durable system for thinking in public without creator pressure
- Attracts meaningful, non-transactional conversations
- Long-lived archive of evolving ideas that compounds over time
