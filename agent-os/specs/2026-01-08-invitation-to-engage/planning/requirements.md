# Invitation to Engage — Requirements

## 1. Primary Contact Method
- Email only: sarin.saurabh@gmail.com
- Direct email link (mailto:), no alternatives

## 2. Placement
- Footer only, consistently across all pages
- Present but unobtrusive
- Same placement everywhere
- NO page-specific CTAs (content does the filtering)

## 3. Tone & Copy
- Brief, calm, non-transactional
- Invitation to think together, not "connect"
- No urgency, no pitch, no CTA language
- Preferred copy options:
  - "If something here resonates and you want to think through a problem together, reach out."
  - "If you'd like to explore a problem together, I'm reachable by email."
- Keep to one sentence

## 4. Engagement Pathways
**Include:** One email link only

**Exclude:**
- Contact forms
- Newsletter signups
- Calendly/scheduling links
- Social sharing buttons
- Multiple contact options

Goal: intentional reach-out, not conversion

## 5. Visual Treatment
- Simple inline text link
- Same underline treatment as other links (existing `.entry-link` pattern)
- No buttons, icons, or visual emphasis
- Should feel like part of reading environment, not a CTA

## 6. Explicit Non-Goals
- No full "Contact" page
- No social media icons/links
- No "Work with me" or services framing
- No availability statements ("open to opportunities", etc.)
- No language that sounds like selling or networking
- This is an invitation, not an ask

## Implementation Principle
When in doubt:
- Intentional > Discoverable
- One clear way > Multiple ways
- Restraint > Prominence

## Technical Notes
- Build into existing `BaseLayout.astro` footer (currently a placeholder with just border-top)
- Follow existing link styling patterns
- No new pages or components needed beyond footer enhancement
