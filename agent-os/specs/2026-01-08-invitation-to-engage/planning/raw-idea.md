# Raw Idea

**Feature Name:** Invitation to Engage

**Description:** Add clear but understated contact/engagement pathways. Design to encourage thoughtful outreach while the content quality itself filters for serious engagement. This is for a personal website (sarinsaurabh.in) that serves as a thinking space rather than a portfolio or pitch. The engagement pathways should match the minimal, typography-focused aesthetic of the site.

**Size:** XS (extra small)
