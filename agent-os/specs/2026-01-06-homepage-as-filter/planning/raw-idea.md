# Raw Idea: Homepage as Filter

This is for a personal website (sarinsaurabh.in) that showcases problem-first thinking. The homepage should:
- Clearly articulate the problem-first lens
- Signal that this is a thinking space, not a pitch
- Set expectations for depth
- Act as a filter for the right kind of visitors
