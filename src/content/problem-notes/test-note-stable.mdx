# The Documentation Paradox

Organizations invest significant effort in documentation that rarely gets read. This isn't a discipline problem - it's a design problem.

## The Pattern

Documentation fails when it:
- Answers questions nobody is asking
- Exists in isolation from the work
- Optimizes for coverage over clarity

## The Reframe

Effective documentation isn't about capturing everything. It's about making the right information available at the right moment.

This means treating documentation as a product with users, not a compliance exercise. The teams that do this well share common patterns:

1. They document decisions, not just outcomes
2. They link documentation to workflows
3. They measure whether it helps

## Conclusion

The paradox resolves when we stop asking "did we document this?" and start asking "can people find what they need?"
