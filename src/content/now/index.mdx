## What I'm working on

Building out this personal site as a space for thinking in public. The focus right now is on creating a foundation that makes it easy to write and share without the pressure of polished publishing.

Also exploring how to integrate AI tools into my workflow in ways that feel genuine and useful, rather than performative.

## What I'm thinking about

The tension between depth and breadth in professional work. How do you stay curious about many things while building real expertise in a few? I don't have good answers yet, but I'm paying attention to how I actually spend my time versus how I think I should.

## What I'm learning

Reading more about systems thinking and how complex problems resist simple solutions. Currently working through some foundational texts on this, taking notes as I go.

Also revisiting fundamentals of web accessibility, which keeps revealing how much I don't know.

## Availability

Open to conversations about product development, technical architecture, or any of the topics I write about here. Not looking for new full-time roles at the moment, but happy to chat.
